## Introduction

`Debloatfy` streamlines the management of your Android devices directly from your macOS system with an intuitive SwiftUI interface.

With Debloatfy, you can effortlessly transfer files between your macOS and Android devices, manage applications, and create backups—all through a single, elegant interface leveraging ADB connectivity.

Powered by optimized ADB commands, Debloatfy provides comprehensive device information and allows you to quickly remove unwanted bloatware, backup valuable applications, and restore them when needed, giving you complete control over your Android phone.

Experience lightning-fast file transfers for high-volume data between your computer and Android device, while the custom logging system keeps you informed of every operation in real-time, ensuring transparency and confidence in your device management workflow.

## Purpose

I've always been an Android user, appreciating the freedom and flexibility the operating system provides. However, Android has one persistent issue: manufacturers preload devices with numerous bloatware applications that can't be removed through normal means.

Previously, I relied on terminal commands and ADB to remove these unwanted apps and quickly transfer files to my computer before resetting my device. After doing this process manually countless times, I asked myself: why not create a user-friendly GUI to simplify these tasks?

That's how `Debloatfy` was born—a tool designed to bridge the gap between macOS and Android, making device management accessible without requiring terminal expertise.

## How To Use

To use the "Debloatfy", you need to follow the steps below.:

```bash

  Navigate to Settings > About Phone. Locate the Build Number and tap it 7 times. You'll see a message confirming "Developer options enabled"

# Step 2 - Enable USB Debugging:
  Go back to Settings and find the new Developer options menu. Toggle on "USB debugging". Accept the security prompt when it appears

# Step 3 - Connect Your Device:
  Use a USB cable to connect your Android device to your MacOS device. Ensure your device is unlocked

# Step 4 - Grant Permissions:
  When prompted on your Android device, check "Always allow from this computer"

# Step 5 - Ready to Use:
  Debloatfy will detect your device and you can begin managing it
```

> **Note:**
